# Cross-Region VCN Peering in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
## Introduction
As organizations adopt multi-region cloud architectures for high availability and disaster recovery, connecting networks across regions becomes essential. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) supports Cross-Region Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) Peering using Dynamic Routing Gateways (DRG) to enable private, secure communication between VCNs in different regions.

In this blog, we’ll walk through the steps to set up Cross-Region VCN Peering in OCI, enabling seamless communication between workloads hosted in different regions.

## Use Case
You're running workloads in two regions:
- swtrl-vcn1 in switerland
- abu-vcn1 in abu bhabi

> **Goal**: Enable private IP-based communication between these VCNs without using the public internet.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin:
*   Two VCNs in different regions (with non-overlapping CIDR blocks)
*   OCI user with appropriate IAM policies
*   Basic understanding of OCI Networking (VCNs, subnets, route tables)

### Step-by-Step Setup
#### Step 1: Create DRGs in Both Regions
Navigate to each region and:
*   Go to Networking > Dynamic Routing Gateways.
*   Click Create DRG.
*   Name them (e.g., DRG-STRL, DRG-ABU) and click Create.

#### Step 2: Attach Each DRG to Its VCN
For each DRG:
1.  Go to the VCN → Dynamic Routing Gateways
2.  Click Attach DRG
    -   Select the DRG you created
    -   Click Attach

#### Step 3: Create Remote Peering Connection (RPC)
Do this for both DRGs:
1.  Go to DRG Details → Remote Peering Connections
2.  Click Create Remote Peering Connection
    1.  Name: RPC-SWTL  and RPC-ABU 
3.  Save the RPC

#### Step 4: Establish Peering Between RPCs
Go to one DRG’s RPC (e.g., RPC-SWTL) and click Establish Peering:
1.  Choose RPC in another region
2.  Select the region 
3.  provide the target RPC ocid (RPC-ABU)
4.  Click Establish Peering

#### Step 5: Update Route Tables in Both VCNs
Update the Route Table for each subnet that needs to communicate across regions:
VCN-A Route Table (switzerland)
*   Destination: 10.1.0.0/16
*   Target Type: Dynamic Routing Gateway
*   Target: DRG-STRL

VCN-B Route Table (Abu dabhi)
*   Destination: 10.0.0.0/16  or only the subnet cidr range(10.0.2.0/24)
*   Target Type: Dynamic Routing Gateway
*   Target: DRG-ABU

#### Step 6: Update Security Lists or NSGs
Make sure Security Lists (or NSGs) allow ingress/egress for the remote CIDR ranges:
Example for VCN-A:
```    
    Ingress Rule: Source 10.1.0.0/16 → Allow TCP/ICMP
    Egress Rule: Destination 10.1.0.0/16 → Allow TCP/ICMP
```
Repeat similarly for VCN-B.

#### Testing
Launch VMs in both regions in the subnets.
Ping each other using private IPs.
Ensure firewall and OS-level rules allow communication.
