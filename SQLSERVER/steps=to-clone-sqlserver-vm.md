# Cloning a Microsoft SQL Server VM
Cloning a Microsoft SQL Server VM is a common task when you want to set up a test environment that mirrors your production environment. Below are step-by-step instructions to clone a SQL Server VM (assuming you're using **VMware Workstation**, **Proxmox**, or a similar hypervisor in your homelab setup).

---

## ‚úÖ **Pre-Cloning Checklist**

Before cloning:

1. **Ensure SQL Server is shut down gracefully**.
2. **Back up your databases** (optional but recommended).
3. **Note network and hostname settings** (to avoid conflicts).
4. **Ensure the VM is not using dynamically assigned machine SID if part of a domain**.

## üîÅ **Cloning in VMware Workstation**

### Step 1: Shut Down the VM

* Right-click on the SQL Server VM ‚Üí **Shut Down Guest** or use Windows shutdown command.

### Step 2: Clone the VM

* Right-click on the VM ‚Üí **Manage** ‚Üí **Clone**.
* Choose **"Create a Full Clone"** (recommended for independent testing).
* Choose a name for the test VM.

### Step 3: Configure the Cloned VM

* Change:

  * **Computer name** (via `System Properties > Change settings`)
  * **Static IP address** (if assigned)
  * Ensure it **doesn't automatically join the same domain** unless required.
* Run `sysprep` if you need to generalize it.

### Step 4: Update SQL Server Network Configuration

* Open **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.
* Ensure the correct **IP addresses and ports** are configured (remove any that belong to the original).

### Step 5: Start the Cloned VM

* Power on and verify:

  * Windows boot completes successfully.
  * SQL Server services start properly.
  * No network or SID conflicts.

## üîÅ **Cloning in Proxmox VE**

### Step 1: Shut Down the SQL Server VM

* In the Proxmox UI, right-click the VM ‚Üí **Shutdown**.

### Step 2: Clone the VM

* Right-click the VM ‚Üí **Clone**.
* Select:

  * **Name**: e.g., `sqlserver-test`
  * **Mode**: Choose **Full Clone**.
  * **Target storage** if you want to store the clone elsewhere.

### Step 3: Adjust the Cloned VM Settings

* Edit the hardware:

  * Network MAC address (Proxmox will auto-generate one).
  * Disk or memory allocation if needed.
* Change hostname, IP, and domain SID settings as mentioned above.

### Step 4: Boot and Configure

* Boot the cloned VM.
* Confirm SQL Server is running as expected.
* Optionally, restore a different database backup for testing.

## üîß Optional Post-Clone Tasks

* **Run `sysprep`** if you plan to deploy this clone in multiple environments.
* **Rename SQL Server instance** (not recommended unless absolutely necessary).
* Configure **SQL Server ports/firewall rules** as per the test environment needs.
* If part of an AD environment, **remove and rejoin the domain** with a new hostname.
