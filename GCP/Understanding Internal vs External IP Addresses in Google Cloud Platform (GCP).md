#  Understanding Internal vs External IP Addresses in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

When deploying resources in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, understanding how **internal and external IP addresses** work is crucial for designing secure and scalable architectures.

Whether you're launching a VM, setting up a load balancer, or deploying a Kubernetes cluster, knowing how GCP handles IP addressing helps you:

* Control access,
* Manage costs, and
* Secure your workloads.

Letâ€™s explore the differences, use cases, how to assign them, and key best practices.

##  What Are Internal and External IPs?

| Type            | Scope   | Usage                              | Routable From     |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Internal IP** | Private | VM-to-VM communication inside GCP  | Within GCP only   |
| **External IP** | Public  | Access GCP resources from internet | Internet (global) |

---

## Internal IP Address (Private)

###  Definition:

An **internal IP** is a private IP address assigned to a VM instance, load balancer, or GKE node **within a VPC network**. Itâ€™s used for **private communication** across GCP resources **without exposing them to the internet**.

###  Use Cases:

* Backend services (DB servers, APIs)
* GKE nodes communicating internally
* VM-to-VM or VM-to-database traffic
* Connecting over VPC peering or VPN

###  Internal IP Assignment:

* **Automatic** by GCP from a subnet range (e.g., `10.0.0.0/24`)
* Or **static reservation** to bind the same IP across reboots

####  Assign a Static Internal IP (Console):

1. Go to **VPC Network > IP addresses**
2. Click **Reserve Static IP Address**
3. Choose **Type: Internal**
4. Select the **region and subnet**
5. Reserve and use when creating a VM

####  Using `gcloud`:

```bash
gcloud compute addresses create my-internal-ip \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --subnet=custom-subnet \
  --addresses=10.0.0.100 \
  --purpose=GCE_ENDPOINT \
  --address-type=INTERNAL
```

## External IP Address (Public)

###  Definition:

An **external IP** is a **public IP address** assigned to a VM, load balancer, or other resource that needs to communicate with or be accessed from the **public internet**.

###  Use Cases:

* Web servers and APIs accessed via the internet
* Remote SSH/RDP access to VMs
* Inbound and outbound communication with external systems

###  Security Warning:

Public IPs expose your resource to the internet. Always use:

* Firewall rules
* Identity-aware proxy (IAP)
* Secure VPNs or bastion hosts

###  Types of External IPs:

| Type          | Description                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ephemeral** | Auto-assigned; released on reboot                        |
| **Static**    | Reserved and fixed; ideal for DNS or persistent services |

#### ðŸ“‹ Assign a Static External IP (Console):

1. Go to **VPC Network > External IP addresses**
2. Click **Reserve Static Address**
3. Choose **Type: Regional or Global**
4. Use it during VM or LB setup

#### Using `gcloud`:

```bash
gcloud compute addresses create my-external-ip \
  --region=us-central1
```

##  Best Practices

###  Internal IPs:

* Use internal IPs **by default** for all internal communication
* Use **Private Google Access** for accessing Google APIs privately
* Use **Cloud NAT** for outbound internet access without public IPs

### âœ… External IPs:

* **Avoid exposing VMs directly** â€” use HTTPS Load Balancers with Cloud Armor
* **Use static IPs** for DNS mapping and consistency
* **Restrict access** using firewall rules, service accounts, and Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)

##  Summary: Internal vs External IPs in GCP

| Feature    | Internal IP               | External IP                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Visibility | Private (inside VPC)      | Public (internet-facing)     |
| Scope      | Regional                  | Regional or Global           |
| Use Case   | VM communication, backend | Web access, SSH, APIs        |
| Security   | Not internet accessible   | Requires strict controls     |
| Cost       | Free                      | May incur charges for static |

##  Final Thoughts

IP address management in GCP isnâ€™t just about connectivity â€” itâ€™s about **security, availability, and cost efficiency**. Default to **internal IPs**, use **external IPs only when needed**, and always follow GCPâ€™s **network security best practices**.
