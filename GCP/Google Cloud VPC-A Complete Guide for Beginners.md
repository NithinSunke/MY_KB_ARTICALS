# 🌐 Google Cloud VPC: A Complete Guide for Beginners

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is one of the foundational components of Google Cloud. It allows you to define your own **private network** within GCP, control how your resources communicate, and securely connect your infrastructure.

In this post, we’ll cover everything you need to know about **VPC in GCP**—concepts, components, best practices, and hands-on examples.

## 🧠 What is a VPC?

A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** in GCP is a **global, private, and isolated virtual network** that lets you run your cloud resources like Compute Engine VMs, Kubernetes clusters, and more.

Think of it as your **own datacenter in the cloud**, fully configurable with IP ranges, firewalls, routes, and peering.

## 📦 Core Components of a VPC

1. ###  **Subnets**

   * VPCs are **global**, but **subnets are regional**.
   * You define **IP ranges** for each subnet.
   * Subnets host your resources (like VMs, GKE clusters, etc.).

2. ###  **Routes**

   * Define how traffic moves within and outside the VPC.
   * Every VPC has **default routes**, like `0.0.0.0/0` pointing to the internet via an internet gateway.

3. ###  **Firewall Rules**

   * Stateful rules to **allow or deny** traffic.
   * Applied at the **network level**, not instance level.
   * Supports `allow` (default), but **no `deny` rules** for egress.

4. ### **Peering**

   * Connect one VPC to another privately, across projects or organizations.

5. ###  **Shared VPC**

   * Allows multiple projects to share a central VPC.
   * Best for large organizations with separate billing/project needs.

6. ###  **Cloud NAT, VPN, Interconnect**

   * **NAT**: Allow outbound internet access without exposing internal IPs.
   * **VPN**: Securely connect on-premise to GCP.
   * **Interconnect**: Dedicated physical connection to GCP.

## 🛠️ How to Create a VPC in GCP (Step-by-Step)

### **Option 1: Using Console**

1. Go to [VPC Network page](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/networks).
2. Click **"Create VPC Network"**.
3. Enter:

   * Name: `my-custom-vpc`
   * Subnet creation mode: `Custom`
4. Add subnets:

   * Region: `us-central1`
   * Subnet name: `web-subnet`
   * IP range: `10.10.10.0/24`
5. Click **Create**.

### **Option 2: Using gcloud CLI**

```bash
gcloud compute networks create my-custom-vpc \
  --subnet-mode=custom

gcloud compute networks subnets create web-subnet \
  --network=my-custom-vpc \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --range=10.10.10.0/24
```

---

## 🔐 Firewall Rules Example

```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http \
  --network=my-custom-vpc \
  --allow=tcp:80 \
  --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \
  --target-tags=http-server
```

This allows HTTP (port 80) traffic from anywhere to instances tagged with `http-server`.

---

## 🔄 VPC Peering Example

```bash
gcloud compute networks peerings create peer-1-2 \
  --network=vpc-1 \
  --peer-network=vpc-2 \
  --auto-create-routes
```

Use this when you need private communication between two VPCs (cross-project or same project).

## 🧠 Key Concepts to Remember

| Concept        | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global VPC     | A VPC is global, but its subnets are regional              |
| CIDR           | IP ranges like `10.0.0.0/16` used to define subnets        |
| Custom vs Auto | Custom: You define subnets. Auto: GCP creates default ones |
| Firewall Rules | Control traffic to/from instances                          |
| Shared VPC     | One VPC shared by multiple GCP projects                    |
| Cloud NAT      | Allow egress without assigning external IPs                |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always use Custom mode VPCs** (avoid default/auto unless testing).
2. **Use separate subnets for each environment** (dev, test, prod).
3. **Use tags and service accounts for firewall targeting**.
4. **Apply firewall rules tightly** — no `0.0.0.0/0` unless required.
5. **Use IAM to control who can modify VPC settings**.
6. **Enable Flow Logs** to monitor traffic and troubleshoot.
7. **Keep audit logs** for all network-related changes.

---

## Real-world Use Case Example

**Company Setup**:

* `prod-vpc` with subnets in `us-east1`, `europe-west1`.
* Separate subnet for frontend, backend, and database.
* Use Cloud NAT for secure outbound traffic.
* Use VPC Peering to connect `prod-vpc` and `monitoring-vpc`.

**Benefits**:

* Least privilege access via firewall rules.
* Centralized security management.
* Cost-effective bandwidth through peering.

##  Summary

Google Cloud VPC is the backbone of your cloud network. It gives you complete control over how your applications communicate—both internally and with the outside world.
