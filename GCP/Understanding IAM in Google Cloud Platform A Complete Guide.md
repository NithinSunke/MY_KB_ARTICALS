# Understanding IAM in Google Cloud Platform: A Complete Guide

In the world of cloud computing, controlling **who can access what** is foundational for security and governance. **Google Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management)** provides a flexible and powerful system for managing access to your cloud resources.

Whether you're running a small proof-of-concept or managing enterprise workloads, understanding IAM is **essential for securely operating in GCP**.

---

## What is IAM in GCP?

IAM in Google Cloud is a framework that defines:

* **Who (identity)** can
* **Do what (role/permission)**
* **On which resource**

IAM controls access across all GCP services such as Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, and more.

## 🧩 Core Components of IAM

### 1. **Identities (Who is accessing?)**

Identities are the entities that interact with GCP.

| Identity Type                 | Description              | Example                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Account                | Individual user account  | `user:john@example.com`                                 |
| Google Group                  | A group of users         | `group:devs@example.com`                                |
| Service Account               | Used by apps or services | `serviceAccount:my-app@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |
| G Suite/Cloud Identity domain | Entire domain            | `domain:example.com`                                    |
| All users                     | Anyone on the internet   | `allUsers`                                              |
| Authenticated users           | Any signed-in user       | `allAuthenticatedUsers`                                 |

---

### 2. **Resources (What is being accessed?)**

Resources are GCP services and components like:

* Projects
* Virtual Machines (Compute Engine)
* Cloud Storage Buckets
* BigQuery Datasets
* Cloud Pub/Sub Topics
* APIs

---

### 3. **Roles (What access is granted?)**

Roles are collections of **permissions**.

#### 🔹 Predefined Roles

GCP provides **fine-grained, service-specific roles**.

* `roles/viewer` – read-only access to all resources
* `roles/editor` – read-write access
* `roles/storage.objectViewer` – read-only access to Cloud Storage objects
* `roles/compute.admin` – full control over Compute Engine resources

#### 🔸 Custom Roles

You can create custom roles with only the permissions your team needs.

#### ⚠️ Basic Roles *(Not recommended for production)*

* `Owner` – full access, including IAM (dangerous!)
* `Editor` – full access without IAM
* `Viewer` – read-only access

> **Use predefined or custom roles instead of basic roles to follow the principle of least privilege.**

---

### 4. **Policy**

IAM policy is a collection of **bindings**: each binding associates **members** with **roles**.

#### Example Policy JSON:

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "role": "roles/storage.admin",
      "members": [
        "user:alice@example.com",
        "group:devops@example.com"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## IAM Policy Hierarchy

IAM policies in GCP are **hierarchical** and can be applied at the following levels:

```
Organization (optional)
   └── Folders (optional)
         └── Projects
               └── Resources
```

* **Policies are inherited down** the hierarchy.
* This allows broad policies at the org level and specific exceptions at lower levels.

## 🛠️ How to Manage IAM

### Using the Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to **IAM & Admin → IAM**
2. Click **“Grant Access”**
3. Enter the **principal (user/service account)**
4. Assign a **role**
5. Click **Save**

### Using gcloud CLI:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \
  --member="user:john@example.com" \
  --role="roles/compute.viewer"
```

### Using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "google_project_iam_binding" "viewer_binding" {
  project = "my-project-id"
  role    = "roles/viewer"

  members = [
    "user:john@example.com",
  ]
}
```

## Common Use Cases

| Task                           | Recommended Role                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Read-only access to a project  | `roles/viewer`                                        |
| Deploy code to Cloud Functions | `roles/cloudfunctions.developer`                      |
| Admin access to VMs            | `roles/compute.admin`                                 |
| Grant access to storage bucket | `roles/storage.objectViewer` or `roles/storage.admin` |
| Audit IAM changes              | `roles/iam.securityReviewer`                          |

---

## IAM in Action: Scenario

**Scenario**: You want to give a developer read-only access to BigQuery datasets in a project.

* Go to **IAM & Admin → IAM**
* Add member: `user:dev@example.com`
* Assign role: `roles/bigquery.dataViewer`

Now, the developer can query but not modify or delete datasets.

## IAM Best Practices

| Practice                                     | Why It Matters                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Use **least privilege**                      | Minimizes risk if credentials are compromised |
| Prefer **groups over individuals**           | Easier to manage at scale                     |
| Audit IAM policies regularly                 | Detect overly broad permissions               |
| Use **custom roles** for sensitive workflows | Fine-grained control                          |
| Avoid `Owner` role                           | Too much power, especially in production      |
| Use **service accounts** for automation      | Secure and trackable                          |

## IAM vs Organization Policies

| Feature          | IAM                          | Organization Policies                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| What it controls | Who can access what          | Enforce constraints on resource behavior |
| Scope            | Roles and permissions        | Service usage policies                   |
| Example          | Assign `roles/compute.admin` | Block external IPs on VMs                |

## Final Thoughts

IAM in Google Cloud is a **cornerstone of security and compliance**. Mastering it helps you:

* Prevent data breaches
* Enforce principle of least privilege
* Simplify user and service account access
* Audit and monitor access effectively

> Whether you're building in the free tier or scaling to enterprise workloads, understanding IAM is critical for a secure and manageable cloud foundation.
