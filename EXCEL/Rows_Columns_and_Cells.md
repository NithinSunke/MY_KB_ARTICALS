# Rows, Columns, and Cells
3Here’s a simple breakdown of **Rows**, **Columns**, and **Cells** in Excel:

---

### 🔢 **Rows**

* **Run horizontally** across the worksheet.
* Identified by **numbers** (1, 2, 3, …).
* There are over **1 million rows** in a worksheet (1,048,576 to be exact in Excel 365).

📌 Example: Row 5 is the 5th horizontal line across the sheet.

---

### 🔤 **Columns**

* **Run vertically** down the worksheet.
* Identified by **letters** (A, B, C, …, Z, AA, AB, …).
* Excel has up to **16,384 columns** (last one is **XFD**).

📌 Example: Column B is the 2nd vertical line in the sheet.

---

### 🧩 **Cells**

* A **cell** is the intersection of a **row and a column**.
* Each cell has a unique address based on its column and row.

📌 Example:

* **Cell A1** = column A and row 1.
* **Cell C5** = column C and row 5.

You enter data (like numbers, text, formulas) into **cells**.

### 🗂️ Visual Example (Simplified):

|   | A  | B  | C  |
| - | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | A1 | B1 | C1 |
| 2 | A2 | B2 | C2 |
| 3 | A3 | B3 | C3 |

* **A2** = Column A, Row 2 → This is a **cell**.
* **Row 3** = A3, B3, C3
* **Column B** = B1, B2, B3
