# Workbook vs Worksheet

Great question! Here's the difference between a **workbook** and a **worksheet** in Excel:

---

### üìò **Workbook**

* A **workbook** is the **entire Excel file**.
* It contains **one or more worksheets**.
* File extension is usually `.xlsx` or `.xls`.

‚úÖ Example: When you save a file called `Budget2025.xlsx`, you're saving the **workbook**.

### üìÑ **Worksheet**

* A **worksheet** (also called a **sheet**) is a **single tab** within a workbook.
* It's made up of a **grid of rows and columns** where you enter and manipulate data.
* Each worksheet has a **name**, like `Sheet1`, `Sales`, or `Inventory`.

‚úÖ Example: In your `Budget2025.xlsx` file, you might have three worksheets:

* `January`
* `February`
* `Summary`
